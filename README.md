# BDD
BDD guidance to work with AI assistants

## AI-Powered BDD Documentation System

This documentation system is designed to facilitate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in conjunction with AI-powered development tools. It provides a structured approach to project management, development, and documentation that maximizes the effectiveness of AI assistance while maintaining high code quality and business alignment.

## üìö Document Structure

1. **Project Management** (`bdd_00_project_management.md`)
   - Overall development workflow
   - Best practices for code quality
   - Testing strategies
   - Maintenance guidelines
   - Communication protocols

2. **Business Documentation Rules** (`bdd_01_business_doc_rules.md`)
   - Guidelines for writing business requirements
   - User story formatting
   - Business rule documentation
   - Acceptance criteria standards

3. **Pre-Implementation Testing** (`bdd_02_pre_impl_test_phase.md`)
   - Business-focused E2E test specifications
   - Implementation-agnostic test guidelines
   - Test scenario documentation
   - Coverage requirements

4. **Technical Documentation Rules** (`bdd_03_tdd_doc_rules.md`)
   - Technical design specifications
   - Architecture documentation
   - Interface definitions
   - Implementation guidelines

5. **Technical Stack** (`my-stack.mdc`)
   - Technology choices and constraints
   - Development environment setup
   - Tool configurations
   - Best practices for the chosen stack

## ü§ñ Using with AI-Powered Development

### 1. Requirements Phase
- Share the business documentation (`bdd_01`) with your AI assistant
- Ask the AI to review and validate requirements
- Use AI to generate additional test scenarios
- Let AI identify potential edge cases

### 2. Design Phase
- Reference `bdd_02` for test-first approach
- Ask AI to generate test specifications
- Use AI to validate technical design against business requirements
- Let AI suggest architectural improvements

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Share `bdd_03` and `my-stack.mdc` with AI
- Request AI to generate implementation code
- Use AI for code review and optimization
- Ask AI to ensure documentation compliance

### 4. Testing Phase
- Use AI to generate test cases
- Ask AI to validate test coverage
- Let AI suggest additional test scenarios
- Use AI to verify business requirement alignment

## üîë Key Principles for AI Interaction

1. **Clear Communication**
   - Provide context from relevant documentation
   - Ask specific, focused questions
   - Request explanations for AI decisions

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Start with small, well-defined tasks
   - Validate AI outputs against requirements
   - Iterate based on feedback

3. **Documentation First**
   - Always reference relevant documentation sections
   - Ask AI to update documentation as needed
   - Maintain documentation-code synchronization

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Use AI to verify compliance with standards
   - Request code reviews from AI
   - Validate AI outputs against best practices

## üìã Best Practices

1. **Document References**
   ```
   When asking AI for help, reference specific documents:
   "Based on bdd_01_business_doc_rules.md, generate..."
   ```

2. **Context Sharing**
   ```
   Share relevant sections of documentation:
   "According to the testing guidelines in bdd_02..."
   ```

3. **Validation Requests**
   ```
   Ask AI to validate work:
   "Please verify this implementation against bdd_03..."
   ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Read through all documentation files in numerical order
2. Set up your AI-powered IDE with the technical stack specified
3. Follow the project management workflow in `bdd_00`
4. Use the documentation as a reference during development
5. Keep documentation updated as the project evolves

## üîÑ Maintenance

- Regularly review and update documentation
- Use AI to suggest documentation improvements
- Keep technical stack information current
- Document any deviations from standard practices

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to this documentation:
1. Follow the formatting guidelines
2. Maintain consistent terminology
3. Update all relevant sections
4. Validate changes with the team
5. Use AI to verify documentation quality

Remember: This documentation system is designed to be a living reference that evolves with your project while maintaining consistency and quality through AI-assisted development.

# Project Management Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### 1. Requirements and Documentation Phase
- Start with BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) specifications
  - Write user stories in business language
  - Define scenarios that cover all use cases
  - Document business rules and constraints
  - Avoid technical implementation details at this stage

### 2. Pre-Implementation Testing Phase
- Create business-focused E2E tests
  - Use pure business interfaces
  - Avoid technical assumptions (HTTP, database, etc.)
  - Focus on business outcomes
  - Use domain-specific language
  - Keep tests implementation-agnostic

### 3. Technical Design Phase
- Create Technical Design Document (TDD)
  - Bridge business requirements to technical implementation
  - Define system architecture and components
  - Specify interfaces and data structures
  - Document technical constraints and considerations
  - Plan for scalability and maintenance

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Write technical E2E tests based on business tests
  - Implement the minimal code to pass tests
  - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
  - Document code with clear comments

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
1. Keep code simple and readable
   - Files should be under 200 lines
   - Functions should be small and focused
   - Use clear, consistent naming conventions
   - Write extensive documentation

2. Modular Design
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Minimal dependencies between components
   - Easy to test and maintain

### Testing Strategy
1. Business Tests
   - Focus on business requirements
   - Use business language
   - Implementation-agnostic
   - Cover all use cases

2. Technical Tests
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - E2E tests for complete workflows
   - Performance and load tests as needed

### Documentation Requirements
1. Business Documentation
   - BDD specifications
   - User stories
   - Business rules
   - Use cases and scenarios

2. Technical Documentation
   - Architecture diagrams
   - API specifications
   - Data models
   - Deployment instructions

### Error Handling
1. Problem Resolution
   - Analyze root causes thoroughly
   - Consider multiple possible solutions
   - Make minimal necessary changes
   - Document all changes and reasoning

2. Error Prevention
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Implement proper validation
   - Use type checking and linting
   - Follow security best practices

## Development Cycle

1. Planning
   - Review requirements
   - Create BDD specifications
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Estimate effort

2. Design
   - Create technical design
   - Review with team
   - Plan test strategy
   - Document decisions

3. Implementation
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features
   - Refactor as needed
   - Document code

4. Review
   - Code review
   - Test coverage review
   - Documentation review
   - Performance review

5. Deployment
   - Staging environment testing
   - Integration testing
   - Production deployment
   - Monitoring and feedback

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Code Updates
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Remove deprecated code
   - Maintain documentation
   - Update tests as needed

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Error rate tracking
   - User feedback collection

3. Technical Debt
   - Regular refactoring sessions
   - Documentation updates
   - Test suite maintenance
   - Architecture reviews

## Communication Guidelines

1. Team Communication
   - Regular status updates
   - Clear documentation of decisions
   - Prompt issue reporting
   - Knowledge sharing sessions

2. Stakeholder Communication
   - Regular progress reports
   - Clear feature documentation
   - User guides and training
   - Feedback collection

## Quality Assurance

1. Code Quality
   - Regular code reviews
   - Automated testing
   - Static code analysis
   - Performance profiling

2. Documentation Quality
   - Keep documentation updated
   - Review for clarity
   - Maintain examples
   - Version control

3. Test Quality

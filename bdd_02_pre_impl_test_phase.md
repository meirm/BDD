# Pre-Implementation Testing Phase Guidelines

## Overview
Pre-implementation testing focuses on validating business requirements before any technical implementation. This phase bridges BDD specifications and technical implementation, ensuring that business logic is thoroughly tested without technical constraints.

## Core Principles

1. Business-First Approach
   - Tests should reflect business requirements, not technical implementation
   - Use business domain language exclusively
   - Avoid technical terms (HTTP, database, API, etc.)
   - Focus on business outcomes and behaviors

2. Implementation Agnostic
   - Tests should not assume any specific technical solution
   - Avoid references to specific technologies or frameworks
   - Tests should remain valid regardless of implementation choices
   - Focus on what the system does, not how it does it

3. Pure Business Interface
   - Use business-oriented method names
   - Accept and return business domain objects
   - Avoid technical parameters or return types
   - Keep interfaces simple and focused

## Test Structure

### 1. Test Organization
   - Group tests by business feature
   - Maintain clear separation between features
   - Use descriptive, business-focused names
   - Follow consistent naming patterns

### 2. Test Components
   ```python
   # Example structure (conceptual, not implementation)
   class TicketManagement:
       def assign_ticket_to_agent(self, agent_id, ticket_type, priority):
           """
           Business interface for ticket assignment
           - No HTTP/REST assumptions
           - No database IDs
           - No technical implementation details
           """
           pass

       def check_agent_availability(self, agent_id, ticket_type):
           """
           Pure business logic for agent availability checking
           - Returns business-relevant information
           - No technical status codes
           - No implementation-specific details
           """
           pass
   ```

## Writing Pre-Implementation Tests

### 1. Business Scenario Tests
```python
def test_ticket_assignment_to_agent():
    """
    Business scenario: Assigning ticket to agent
    - Uses business language
    - Clear success criteria
    - No technical details
    """
    # Arrange
    agent = create_test_agent("John Smith")
    ticket_manager = TicketManagement()

    # Act
    result = ticket_manager.assign_ticket_to_agent(
        agent_id=agent.id,
        ticket_type="Support",
        priority="High"
    )

    # Assert
    assert result.is_successful
    assert result.assigned_priority == "High"
    assert result.ticket_type == "Support"
```

### 2. Edge Case Tests
```python
def test_agent_workload_limit():
    """
    Business scenario: Handling agent workload limits
    - Focus on business rules
    - Clear error conditions
    - Business-relevant assertions
    """
    # Arrange
    agent = create_test_agent("Jane Smith")
    ticket_manager = TicketManagement()
    # Assign maximum allowed tickets
    for _ in range(5):
        ticket_manager.assign_ticket_to_agent(agent.id, "Support", "Medium")

    # Act
    availability = ticket_manager.check_agent_availability(agent.id, "Support")

    # Assert
    assert not availability.can_accept_tickets
    assert availability.reason == "Maximum workload reached"
```

## Best Practices

1. Test Isolation
   - Each test should be independent
   - No dependencies on other tests
   - Clear setup and teardown
   - No shared state between tests

2. Test Clarity
   - Clear test names describing business scenarios
   - Well-structured arrange/act/assert pattern
   - Descriptive assertion messages
   - Documented test purpose and expectations

3. Test Coverage
   - Cover all business rules
   - Include edge cases
   - Test error conditions
   - Verify business constraints

4. Test Maintenance
   - Keep tests focused on business logic
   - Update tests when business rules change
   - Maintain test documentation
   - Regular test review and cleanup

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Technical Implementation Details
   - ❌ HTTP status codes
   - ❌ Database queries
   - ❌ API endpoints
   - ❌ Framework-specific features

2. Technical Assumptions
   - ❌ Specific data formats (JSON, XML)
   - ❌ Technical error messages
   - ❌ Implementation-specific behaviors
   - ❌ Technology stack dependencies

## Example: Ticket System Pre-Implementation Tests

### Business Interface Example
```python
class TicketSystem:
    def assign_workload_policy(self, agent, policy_details):
        """
        Business interface for workload policy assignment
        
        Parameters:
        - agent: Agent business object
        - policy_details: Policy configuration in business terms
        
        Returns:
        - Assignment result in business terms
        """
        pass

    def check_ticket_assignment_allowed(self, agent, ticket_type):
        """
        Business interface for ticket assignment permission check
        
        Parameters:
        - agent: Agent business object
        - ticket_type: Type of ticket (Support/Maintenance)
        
        Returns:
        - Permission result in business terms
        """
        pass
```

### Test Examples
```python
def test_workload_policy_update():
    """
    Business scenario: Workload policy update for agent
    """
    # Arrange
    agent = create_test_agent()
    policy = create_test_policy(
        support_ticket_limit=5,
        maintenance_ticket_limit=3,
        priority_override="High"
    )
    ticket_system = TicketSystem()

    # Act
    result = ticket_system.assign_workload_policy(agent, policy)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.support_limit == 5
    assert result.maintenance_limit == 3
    assert result.can_handle_high_priority
```

## Transition to Implementation

1. Review Process
   - Verify all business scenarios are covered
   - Confirm test independence
   - Check for technical assumptions
   - Validate business rule coverage

2. Next Steps
   - Use these tests as basis for technical design
   - Create technical E2E tests based on these tests
   - Implement system components
   - Maintain traceability to business requirements
